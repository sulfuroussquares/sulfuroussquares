### Hi, I'm Brian.
- I'm interested in solving challenging problems using technology.
    - More specifically, I really like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
    - I also spend a lot of time coding using web-centric technologies in order to provide *versatile options for delivering a story*.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to make and deliver dynamic web applications using **React.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**.
